Embrace your travelling lifestyle in luxury and practicality.

Destroy all of the New Zealand seasons with 4kW diesel heating and ceramic-tinted windows, featuring the remote-controlled, temperature-controlled Maxxfan Delux (900 CFM).

Enjoy all day views with windows all around while seated in Genuine Italian leather clad memory foam seating, bed, captains and passenger chairs, or watch the waves roll in at the side of the bed with rear barn doors.

Take all the toys and tools with a loading capacity of approximately 1500 KG.

Designed and built in Christchurch, New Zealand, on a very clean, hand-picked 6.9m 2015 Nissan Civilian.

Large lounge/dining/digital workspace for two, including a kitchen with handmade solid macrocarpa benches and okoume ply joinery, all meticulously finished with 5 coats of premium waterproof plant-based oil.

All of the appliances will keep running long after your neighbours with the Apex's massive power generation and storage.

The wetroom is another work of art; all surfaces are sealed with 3 coats of epoxy sealer, then tanked with 3 coats of marine epoxy. The base is then coated with another 3 coats of epoxy brushing polyurethane, making the room completely waterproof and aesthetically stunning. All before the [4mm okoume ply tile board]({{< param "motorhomeURL" >}}products/wood-product/new-york-tile-board/) is cut and grooved, coated with 3 coats of shellac-based sealer on both sides, 3 coats of automotive lacquer, then finally fixed and sealed at all joins.

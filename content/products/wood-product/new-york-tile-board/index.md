Our Tile Board is made from 4mm Okoume (very durable) ply with Poplar core, approximately 4kg per sheet, much lighter than other off-the-shelf offerings such as fibre cement boards and Seratone. In fact we haven't found any 4mm boards that are lighter. Perfect for motorhome and caravan builds.
We use this board in our new motorhome builds because we haven't found anything else lighter or stronger.

The grout lines are cut (0.3mm deep) by hand and look more authentic than the other moulded boards; they actually look like grout!

It has several coats of a premium shellac-based sealer (both sides and end grain), then three coats of a premium satin automotive lacquer (top side & end grain).

Sheet size: 2.4m x 1.2m.<br>
We can also make the shapes you need to order.

Suitable for wall linings in wet areas, kitchens, feature walls, and anywhere else internally.

This is currently made to order, so expect several days to make. Custom colours other than black or white are possible but will cost extra, check with us first.
